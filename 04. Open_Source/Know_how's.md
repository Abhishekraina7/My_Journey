# What the hell is Open_source anyway?

#### Imagine you're building a Lego castle. Normally, only you get to see the instructions and decide how it looks.
#### Open source is like sharing those instructions with everyone! They can see how you built it, copy your ideas, or even add their own parts to make it even cooler. Anyone can help improve the castle together.
#### In the world of computers, open source means everyone can see and change the code that makes software work. This lets people fix problems, add new features, and learn from each other. It's a way of working together to build better things!


# Why so much Hype around Open_source?
 - > #### Shows practical coding skills
 - > #### Enhances your portfolio
 - > #### Helps build networks
 - > #### Demonstrates passion and initiative

   #### Remember, open source is a great way to complement your learning and make you a more attractive candidate, but focus on acquiring the specific skills employers are looking for as well.
