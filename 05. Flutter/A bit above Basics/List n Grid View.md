## What Is List View 

#### A list view is a graphical user interface (GUI) element that displays a scrollable list of items. It's a fundamental component in many applications, allowing users to easily browse through collections of data.

## Here's a breakdown of key characteristics:

  > #### Scrollable: A list view typically allows users to vertically scroll through a long list of items that might not all fit on the screen at once.
  > #### Items: Each entry in the list is an "item" that can be text, images, icons, or even custom UI elements.
  > #### Data Source: List views are populated with data from various sources, such as arrays, databases, or APIs.
  > #### Customization: You can often customize the appearance of individual items and the overall layout of the list view (e.g., spacing, background color).
