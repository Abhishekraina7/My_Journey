## What the hell is Flutter anyway ( in short )?
#### Flutter is an open-source UI framework by Google for building beautiful, high-performance apps for mobile (iOS, Android), web, desktop, and even embedded devices.
## Why use it if you have android native?
-  #### **_Cross-Platform:_** Develop once, deploy everywhere. Reduce code duplication and maintenance costs.
-  #### _**Hot Reload:**_ See code changes reflected in the running app instantly, boosting developer productivity.
-  #### **_Customizable UI_** Build visually stunning and unique UIs with Flutter's rich widget library.
-  #### **_High Performance:_** Enjoy smooth animations and native-like performance with a custom rendering engine.
-  #### **_Dart:_** Leverage a modern, object-oriented language with a familiar syntax (similar to Java/Kotlin) for a smooth development experience.

## Cross-Platform vs. Native Development: A Trade-Off

### Cross-Platform (e.g., Flutter):
-  #### Pros: Faster development, wider reach with single codebase, easier maintenance.
-  #### Cons: Potential performance limitations compared to native, some platform-specific features might require additional work.

### Native Development (e.g., Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android):
-  #### Pros: Optimal performance, full access to native features and APIs.
-  #### Cons: More development time and effort due to separate codebases, higher maintenance cost.
