- In modern JavaScript, **top-level await is supported in modules (not in scripts).**
   
- This means that if you're running this code in a module (i.e., a file with a .mjs extension or a file that's being imported as a module), **the await keyword can be used at the top level.**

# WHAT IS A MODULE

- In JavaScript, a module is a file that contains a ***self-contained piece of code that can be imported and used by other files or scripts***. 
  
- Modules are a way to organize and structure code in a modular fashion, making it easier to write, maintain, and reuse code.
- A module can contain variables, functions, classes, and other declarations, just like a regular JavaScript file.
