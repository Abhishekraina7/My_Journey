***.then()*** is a method that is used to handle the result of a promise. A promise is like a container that holds a value that may not be available yet, but will be at some point in the future.

* ## How does .then() work? 

When you call a function that returns a promise, it's like sending a request to a restaurant to prepare a meal. 

The restaurant (the function) says, "Okay, I'll start preparing your meal, but it's going to take a few minutes. I'll let you know when it's ready."

The ***.then()*** method is like saying, "Okay, restaurant, when my meal is ready, please bring it to me and I'll do something with it."
