**JavaScript is considered a prototype-based object-oriented language rather than a class-based one.** 

***It supports key object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation and inheritance, but it does so through prototypes rather than traditional classes.***

Key Points:

**Prototype-Based:** JavaScript uses prototypes for inheritance, allowing objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects.

**Encapsulation:** While JavaScript allows for encapsulation, it does not enforce it as strictly as class-based languages like Java or C++.

**Dynamic Typing:** JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning types are determined at runtime, which differs from the static typing of many traditional OOP languages.

**Multi-Paradigm:** JavaScript supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural and functional programming, in addition to OOP.
