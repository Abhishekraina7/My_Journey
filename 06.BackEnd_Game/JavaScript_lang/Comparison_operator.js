COMPARISON OPERATORS
You're already familiar with these inequality operators, and they work as you would expect in JavaScript:

5 < 6 // evaluates to true
5 > 6 // evaluates to false
5 >= 6 // evaluates to false
5 <= 6 // evaluates to true

*/

console.log(5 > 6)
console.log(5 === 6)
console.log(5 === '5')
console.log(6 >= 6)

/* The unique equality operators are 

1) STRICT   EQUALS  i.e (=== and !==) teen equals (it checks the value as well as type(int, bool, string) )
2) LOOSE    EQUALS  i.e (== and !=) like java or dart or C (it checks only the value)

You should be using the Strict equals in good code brother always remember that

*/


// TASK IS TO CHANGE THE OPERATOR IN A WAY THAT EVERY CONDITION EVALUATES TO TRUE

//DONE 
console.log(5 < 6)
console.log(5 !== 6)
console.log(5 == '5')
console.log(6 >= 6)
